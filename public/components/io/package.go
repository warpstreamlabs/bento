// Package io contains component implementations that have a small dependency
// footprint (mostly standard library) and interact with external systems via
// the filesystem and/or network sockets.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL: The specific components excluded by this package may change
// outside of major version releases. This means we may choose to remove certain
// plugins if we determine that their dependencies are likely to interfere with
// the goals of this package.
