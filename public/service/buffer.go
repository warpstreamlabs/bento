// BatchBuffer is an interface implemented by Buffers able to read and write
// message batches. Buffers are a component type that are placed after inputs,
// and decouples the acknowledgement system of the inputs from the rest of the
// pipeline.
//
// Buffers are useful when implementing buffers intended to relieve back
// pressure from upstream components, or when implementing message aggregators
// where the concept of discrete messages running through a pipeline no longer
// applies (such as with windowing algorithms).
//
// Buffers are advanced component types that weaken delivery guarantees of a
// Bento pipeline. Therefore, if you aren't absolutely sure that a component
// you wish to build should be a buffer type then it likely shouldn't be.
type BatchBuffer interface {
	// Write a batch of messages to the buffer, the batch is accompanied with an
	// acknowledge function. A non-nil error should be returned if it is not
	// possible to store the given message batch in the buffer.
	//
	// If a nil error is returned the buffer assumes responsibility for calling
	// the acknowledge function at least once during the lifetime of the
	// message.
	//
	// This could be at the point where the message is written to the buffer,
	// which weakens delivery guarantees but can be useful for decoupling the
	// input from downstream components. Alternatively, this could be when the
	// associated batch has been read from the buffer and acknowledged
	// downstream, which preserves delivery guarantees.
	WriteBatch(context.Context, MessageBatch, AckFunc) error

	// Read a batch of messages from the buffer. This call should block until
	// either a batch is ready to consume, the provided context is cancelled or
	// EndOfInput has been called which indicates that the buffer is no longer
	// being populated with new messages.
	//
	// The returned acknowledge function will be called when a consumed message
	// batch has been processed and sent downstream. It is up to the buffer
	// implementation whether the ack function is used, it might be used in
	// order to "commit" the removal of a message from the buffer in cases where
	// the buffer is a persisted storage solution, or in cases where the output
	// of the buffer is temporal (a windowing algorithm, etc) it might be
	// considered correct to simply drop message batches that are not acked.
	//
	// When the buffer is closed (EndOfInput has been called and no more
	// messages are available) this method should return an ErrEndOfBuffer in
	// order to indicate the end of the buffered stream.
	//
	// It is valid to return a batch of only one message.
	ReadBatch(context.Context) (MessageBatch, AckFunc, error)

	// EndOfInput indicates to the buffer that the input has ended and that once
	// the buffer is depleted it should return ErrEndOfBuffer from ReadBatch in
	// order to gracefully shut down the pipeline.
	//
	// EndOfInput should be idempotent as it may be called more than once.
