Put messages in a NATS object-store bucket.

Introduced in version 1.7.0.

The field `object_name` supports
[interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries), allowing
you to create a unique object name for each message.

### Connection Name

When monitoring and managing a production NATS system, it is often useful to
know which connection a message was send/received from. This can be achieved by
setting the connection name option when creating a NATS connection.

Bento will automatically set the connection name based off the label of the given
NATS component, so that monitoring tools between NATS and bento can stay in sync.
### Authentication

There are several components within Bento which utilise NATS services. You will find that each of these components
support optional advanced authentication parameters for [NKeys](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth)
and [User Credentials](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/security/creds).

An in depth tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/security/jwt).

#### NKey file

The NATS server can use these NKeys in several ways for authentication. The simplest is for the server to be configured
with a list of known public keys and for the clients to respond to the challenge by signing it with its private NKey
configured in the `nkey_file` field.

More details [here](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/security/nkey).

#### User Credentials

NATS server supports decentralized authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Clients need an [user JWT](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt#json-web-tokens)
and a corresponding [NKey secret](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/security/nkey) when connecting to a server
which is configured to use this authentication scheme.

The `user_credentials_file` field should point to a file containing both the private key and the JWT and can be
generated with the [nsc tool](https://docs.nats.io/nats-tools/nsc).

Alternatively, the `user_jwt` field can contain a plain text JWT and the `user_nkey_seed`can contain
the plain text NKey Seed.

More details [here](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/security/creds).

## Fields

### `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

urls:
  - nats://127.0.0.1:4222

urls:
  - nats://username:password@127.0.0.1:4222
```

### `bucket`

The name of the object store bucket.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

bucket: my_bucket
```

### `object_name`

The object name for each message.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `int`  
Default: `64`  

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 1.0.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

### `auth`

Optional configuration of NATS authentication parameters.


Type: `object`  

### `auth.nkey_file`

An optional file containing a NKey seed.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

nkey_file: ./seed.nk
```

### `auth.user_credentials_file`

An optional file containing user credentials which consist of an user JWT and corresponding NKey seed.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

user_credentials_file: ./user.creds
```

### `auth.user_jwt`

An optional plain text user JWT (given along with the corresponding user NKey Seed).
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
