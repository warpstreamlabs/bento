:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Sends messages to an S2 stream.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values

    auth_token: "" # No default (required)

Generate an authentication token by logging onto the web console at
[s2.dev](https://s2.dev/dashboard).

### Metadata

The metadata attributes are set as S2 record headers. Currently, only string
attribute values are supported.

### Batching

The plugin expects batched inputs. Messages are batched automatically by Bento.

By default, Bento disables batching based on `count`, `byte_size`, and `period`
parameters, but the plugin enables batching setting both `count` and `byte_size` to
the maximum values supported by S2. It also sets a flush period of `5ms` as a reasonable default.

**Note:** An S2 record batch can be a maximum of 1MiB but the plugin limits the
size of a message to 256KiB since the Bento size limit doesn't take metadata into
account. Moreover, the metered size of the same Bento message will be greater
than the byte size of a Bento message.


## Examples

<Tabs defaultValue="ASCII Starwars" values={[
{ label: 'ASCII Starwars', value: 'ASCII Starwars', },
]}>

<TabItem value="ASCII Starwars">

Consume a network stream into an S2 stream

```yaml
input:
  label: towel_blinkenlights_nl
  socket:
    network: tcp
    address: towel.blinkenlights.nl:23
    scanner:
      lines: {}

output:
  label: s2_starwars
  s2:
    basin: my-favorite-basin
    stream: starwars
    auth_token: "${S2_AUTH_TOKEN}"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Fields

### `basin`

Basin name


Type: `string`  

### `auth_token`

Authentication token for S2 account
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  

### `stream`

Stream name


Type: `string`  

### `fencing_token`

Enforce a fencing token (base64 encoded)


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

fencing_token: aGVsbG8gczI=
```

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m

batching:
  count: 10
  jitter: 0.1
  period: 10s
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.jitter`

A non-negative factor that adds random delay to batch flush intervals, where delay is determined uniformly at random between `0` and `jitter * period`. For example, with `period: 100ms` and `jitter: 0.1`, each flush will be delayed by a random duration between `0-10ms`.


Type: `float`  
Default: `0`  

```yml
# Examples

jitter: 0.01

jitter: 0.1

jitter: 1
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `int`  
Default: `64`
