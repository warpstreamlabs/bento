Executes a command, runs it as a subprocess, and writes messages to it over stdin.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  subprocess:
    name: "" # No default (required)
    args: []
    codec: lines
```

Messages are written according to a specified codec. The process is expected to terminate gracefully when stdin is closed.

If the subprocess exits unexpectedly then Bento will log anything printed to stderr and will log the exit code, and will attempt to execute the command again until success.

The execution environment of the subprocess is the same as the Bento instance, including environment variables and the current working directory.
