:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Encodes messages automatically from schemas obtains from a [Confluent Schema Registry service](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) by polling the service for the latest schema version for target subjects.

If a message fails to encode under the schema then it will remain unchanged and the error can be caught using error handling methods outlined [here](/docs/configuration/error_handling).

Avro, Protobuf and Json schemas are supported, all are capable of expanding from schema references as of v4.22.0.

### Avro JSON Format

By default this processor expects documents formatted as [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding) when encoding with Avro schemas. In this format the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- if its type is `null`, then it is encoded as a JSON `null`;
- otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose value is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is used, for other types the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Foo"]`, where `Foo` is a record name, would encode:

- `null` as `null`;
- the string `"a"` as `{"string": "a"}`; and
- a `Foo` instance as `{"Foo": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Foo` instance.

However, it is possible to instead consume documents in [standard/raw JSON format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) by setting the field [`avro_raw_json`](#avro_raw_json) to `true`.

#### Known Issues

Important! There is an outstanding issue in the [avro serializing library](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro) that bento uses which means it [doesn't encode logical types correctly](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/252). It's still possible to encode logical types that are in-line with the spec if `avro_raw_json` is set to true, though now of course non-logical types will not be in-line with the spec.

### Protobuf Format

This processor encodes protobuf messages either from any format parsed within Bento (encoded as JSON by default), or from raw JSON documents, you can read more about JSON mapping of protobuf messages here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json

#### Multiple Message Support

When a target subject presents a protobuf schema that contains multiple messages it becomes ambiguous which message definition a given input data should be encoded against. In such scenarios Bento will attempt to encode the data against each of them and select the first to successfully match against the data, this process currently *ignores all nested message definitions*. In order to speed up this exhaustive search the last known successful message will be attempted first for each subsequent input.

We will be considering alternative approaches in future so please [get in touch](/community) with thoughts and feedback.


## Fields

### `url`

The base URL of the schema registry service.


Type: `string`  

### `subject`

The schema subject to derive schemas from.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

subject: foo

subject: ${! metadata("kafka_topic") }
```

### `refresh_period`

The period after which a schema is refreshed for each subject, this is done by polling the schema registry service.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"10m"`  

```yml
# Examples

refresh_period: 60s

refresh_period: 1h
```

### `avro_raw_json`

Whether messages encoded in Avro format should be parsed as normal JSON ("json that meets the expectations of regular internet json") rather than [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding). If `true` the schema returned from the subject should be parsed as [standard json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) instead of as [avro json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec). There is a [comment in goavro](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249), the [underlining library used for avro serialization](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro), that explains in more detail the difference between standard json and avro json.
