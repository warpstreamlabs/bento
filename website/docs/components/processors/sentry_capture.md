Captures log events from messages and submits them to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).

Introduced in version 1.0.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
sentry_capture:
  dsn: ""
  message: webhook event received # No default (required)
  context: 'root = {"order": {"product_id": "P93174", "quantity": 5}}' # No default (optional)
  tags: {} # No default (optional)
  environment: ""
  release: ""
  level: INFO
  transport_mode: async
  flush_timeout: 5s
  sampling_rate: 1
```

## Fields

### `dsn`

The DSN address to send sentry events to. If left empty, then SENTRY_DSN is used.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `message`

A message to set on the sentry event
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

message: webhook event received

message: 'failed to find product in database: ${! error() }'
```

### `context`

A mapping that must evaluate to an object-of-objects or `deleted()`. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as additional context.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

context: 'root = {"order": {"product_id": "P93174", "quantity": 5}}'

context: root = deleted()
```

### `tags`

Sets key/value string tags on an event. Unlike context, these are indexed and searchable on Sentry but have length limitations.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `object`  

### `environment`

The environment to be sent with events. If left empty, then SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT is used.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `release`

The version of the code deployed to an environment. If left empty, then the Sentry client will attempt to detect the release from the environment.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `level`

Sets the level on sentry events similar to logging levels.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"INFO"`  
Options: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`.

### `transport_mode`

Determines how events are sent. A sync transport will block when sending each event until a response is received from the Sentry server. The recommended async transport will enqueue events in a buffer and send them in the background.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"async"`  
Options: `async`, `sync`.

### `flush_timeout`

The duration to wait when closing the processor to flush any remaining enqueued events.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `sampling_rate`

The rate at which events are sent to the server. A value of 0 disables capturing sentry events entirely. A value of 1 results in sending all events to Sentry. Any value in between results sending some percentage of events.


Type: `float`  
Default: `1`
