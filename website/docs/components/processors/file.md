Performs operations (read, write, delete, move, stat) on files.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
file:
  operation: read # No default (required)
  path: /tmp/data.txt # No default (required)
  content: Hello World # No default (optional)
  dest: /tmp/backup/${! json("document.id") }.txt # No default (optional)
```

This processor allows you to perform various file operations based on message content. The operation is specified by the 'operation' field, and paths can be dynamically generated using interpolation functions.

### Operations

- **read**: Read file content into the message
- **write**: Write message content to a file
- **delete**: Delete a file
- **move**: Move/rename a file
- **stat**: Get file information without reading content

### Metadata

When reading or getting file info (stat), this processor adds the following metadata fields:

```text
- file_path: The path of the file
- file_size: The size of the file in bytes
- file_mod_time_unix: File modification time as Unix timestamp
- file_mod_time: File modification time in RFC3339 format
- file_name: The name of the file
- file_is_dir: Whether the file is a directory (true/false)
- file_mode: File permissions and mode
```

## Fields

### `operation`

The file operation to perform.


Type: `string`  
Options: `read`, `write`, `delete`, `move`, `stat`.

```yml
# Examples

operation: read

operation: write

operation: delete

operation: move

operation: stat
```

### `path`

The source file path. Supports interpolation for dynamic paths.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

path: /tmp/data.txt

path: /tmp/${! json("document.id") }.txt
```

### `content`

The content to write when operation is 'write'. Supports interpolation.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

content: Hello World

content: ${! content() }

content: ${! json("document.content") }
```

### `dest`

The destination path for 'move' operation. Supports interpolation.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).
