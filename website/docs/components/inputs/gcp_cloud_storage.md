:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.
:::
Downloads objects within a Google Cloud Storage bucket, optionally filtered by a prefix.

Introduced in version 1.0.0.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  gcp_cloud_storage:
    bucket: "" # No default (required)
    prefix: ""
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  gcp_cloud_storage:
    bucket: "" # No default (required)
    prefix: ""
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
    delete_objects: false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- gcs_key
- gcs_bucket
- gcs_last_modified
- gcs_last_modified_unix
- gcs_content_type
- gcs_content_encoding
- All user defined metadata
```

You can access these metadata fields using [function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

### Credentials

By default Bento will use a shared credentials file when connecting to GCP services. You can find out more [in this document](/docs/guides/cloud/gcp).

## Fields

### `bucket`

The name of the bucket from which to download objects.


Type: `string`  

### `prefix`

An optional path prefix, if set only objects with the prefix are consumed.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `scanner`

The [scanner](/docs/components/scanners/about) by which the stream of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once.


Type: `scanner`  
Default: `{"to_the_end":{}}`  
Requires version 1.0.0 or newer  

### `delete_objects`

Whether to delete downloaded objects from the bucket once they are processed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
