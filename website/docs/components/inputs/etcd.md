Watches an etcd key or prefix for new events.

From the [etcd docs](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api/#watch-api):
> The Watch API provides an event-based interface for asynchronously monitoring changes to keys.
> An etcd watch waits for changes to keys by continuously watching from a given revision,
> either current or historical, and streams key updates back to the client.
>
> Watches are long-running requests and use gRPC streams to stream event data.
> A watch stream is bi-directional; the client writes to the stream to establish watches and reads to receive watch events.
> A single watch stream can multiplex many distinct watches by tagging events with per-watch identifiers. 
> This multiplexing helps reducing the memory footprint and connection overhead on the core etcd cluster.

### Events

Each event object is flattened and returned as an array, with each individual event in the form:

```json
{
  "key": "<string or []byte>",
  "value": "<string or []byte>",
  "type": "<'PUT' or 'DELETE'>",
  "version": "<int64>",
  "mod_revision": "<int64>",
  "create_revision": "<int64>",
  "lease": "<int64>"
}
```

Where a `key` or `value` is only a string if it is valid UTF-8.


## Fields

### `endpoints`

A set of URLs (schemes, hosts and ports only) that can be used to communicate with a logical etcd cluster. If multiple endpoints are provided, the Client will attempt to use them all in the event that one or more of them are unusable.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

endpoints:
  - etcd://:2379

endpoints:
  - etcd://localhost:2379

endpoints:
  - etcd://localhost:2379
  - etcd://localhost:22379
  - etcd://localhost:32379
```

### `auth`

Type: `object`  

### `auth.enabled`

Whether to use password authentication


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `auth.username`

The username to authenticate as.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `auth.password`

The password to authenticate with.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `dial_timeout`

Timeout for failing to establish a connection.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `keep_alive_time`

Time after which client pings the server to see if transport is alive.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `keep_alive_timeout`

Time that the client waits for a response for the keep-alive probe. If the response is not received in this time, the connection is closed.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

### `request_timeout`

Timeout for a single request. This includes connection time, any redirects, and header wait time.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 1.0.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

### `auto_sync_interval`

The interval to update endpoints with its latest members. 0 disables auto-sync. By default auto-sync is disabled.


Type: `string`  

### `max_call_send_msg_size`

Type: `int`  

### `max_call_recv_msg_size`

The client-side response receive limit. If 0, it defaults to math.MaxInt32.


Type: `int`  

### `reject_old_cluster`

Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `max_unary_retries`

The maximum number of retries for unary RPCs.


Type: `int`  

### `backoff_wait_between`

The wait time before retrying an RPC.


Type: `string`  

### `backoff_jitter_fraction`

The jitter fraction to randomize backoff wait time.


Type: `float`  

### `key`

Type: `string`  

### `options`

Collection of options to configure an etcd watcher.


Type: `object`  

### `options.with_prefix`

Whether to watch for events on a prefix.


Type: `bool`

Whether to send periodic progress updates every 10 minutes when there is no incoming events.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `options.with_put_filter`

Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `true`
