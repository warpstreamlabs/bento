:::caution EXPERIMENTAL
This component is experimental and therefore subject to change or removal outside of major version releases.
:::
Detects filesystem events. Emits empty messages with metadata describing the event

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  fsevent:
    paths: [] # No default (required)
    is_recursive: false
    watch_new_subdirs: false
```

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- fsevent_path
- fsevent_operation
- fsevent_mod_time_unix
- fsevent_mod_time (RFC3339)
```

You can access these metadata fields using
[function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

|Operation|Cause|
|---------|-----|
|CREATE   |A new pathname was created.|
|WRITE    |The pathname was written to; this does *not* mean the write has finished, and a write can be followed by more writes.|
|REMOVE   |The path was removed; any watches on it will be removed. Some "remove" operations may trigger a RENAME if the file is actually moved (for example "remove to trash" is often a rename).|
|RENAME   |The path was renamed to something else. Any watches on it will be removed.|
|CHMOD    |File attributes were changed. It's generally not recommended to take action on this event, as it may get triggered very frequently by some software. For example, Spotlight indexing on macOS, anti-virus software, backup software, etc.|
